## About the App

Gallery app with automatic cloud sync is great, but hey! Sometimes you should have manual control for which photo should be synced to the cloud, and which photo should be just in your internal gallery, so your photo in the cloud storage is just the right photo you want to save in a long time. You can take your photo or select it from your gallery and then upload it into your firebase cloud storage with this simple and clean camera app âœ¨

To run this project, clone this repo, import it into your Android Studio, and then change the `google-services.json` file with yours from your firebase project. Its mean you should have a firebase project to connect this app to cloud storage.

## Requirements

- Android Studio
- Firebase Cloud Storage
